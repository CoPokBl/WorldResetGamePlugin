# World Reset Game Plugin
This is a Spigot plugin for a gamemode where the world resets every *x* seconds.
Players are teleported to the reset world's spawn with the same inventory, 
health, experience, etc. as before the reset.

## Usage
1. Build the plugin and place the JAR in your server's `plugins` folder.
2. Start the server and join the game.
3. Run `/resetgame start <seconds>` to start the game with resets every specified number of seconds.
4. Profit???

## Contributing
Go for it.

## Status
I made this for fun. It worked last time I checked, I probably won't maintain it.
